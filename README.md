## 🧠 What I Do

I design and develop **embedded firmware** for microcontroller-based systems, with a strong focus on:
- MCU architecture and memory-mapped I/O
- Bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware
- Reliable, well-structured Embedded C code

I like working close to the hardware and understanding how systems behave at low level.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

- Embedded C
- ARM Cortex-M / STM32
- FreeRTOS (tasks, queues, mutexes)
- GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC
- Firmware architecture & debugging

---

## 🔬 Current Focus

- STM32 **bare-metal** projects (register-level, no HAL)
- RTOS design and timing behavior
- Clean firmware architecture for scalable systems

---

## 📁 Projects

My repositories focus on:
- MCU architecture exploration
- Register-level peripheral drivers
- RTOS-based firmware experiments
