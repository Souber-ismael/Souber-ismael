## 🧠 What I Do

I design and develop **embedded firmware** for microcontroller-based and **IoT systems**, with a focus on:
- MCU architecture and memory-mapped I/O
- Bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware
- Wireless connectivity for embedded devices (Wi-Fi, BLE)

I enjoy working close to the hardware and building reliable systems under real constraints.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

- Embedded C
- ARM Cortex-M / STM32 / ESP32
- FreeRTOS
- Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC
- Firmware architecture & debugging

---

## 🔬 Current Focus

- STM32 **bare-metal** projects (register-level, no HAL)
- RTOS design and timing behavior
- IoT firmware with **Wi-Fi and BLE connectivity**
- Clean, scalable firmware architecture
